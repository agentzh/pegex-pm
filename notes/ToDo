  - Pegex::AST subclass of Pegex::Receiver
- Fix 'a b | c' in bootstrap parser
  - Test precedence parsing
- Make pegex->parse repeatable (currently messes up)
- Add $_ support

# New features

- Support grammar class methods as rules
  - sub rule_indent { ... }
- Make atoms be an actual grammar
  - Subclassable, Includable
- Multiple rule definitions per statement

# Error Reporting
- Detailed error reporting
- Add `error` msgs to pegex.pgx
- Report grammar class name
- Report the grammar name if present
- Report the current rule stack
- Report info from the Input object
- Report 'End Of Input' message instead of '><'

# Documentation
- Document each module
- doc subdir make docs

#------------------------------------------
- Support subparser using Input object and certain pos
  - Input object should track position
    - This way it can be handed off to another parse
- parse() method can be partial, rather than full
- parse() method can be passed an ending rule. EOS is default.
- grammar object can have code rules
- receiver classes completely control what is result
  - Move default actions from parser to receiver

#------------------------------------------
- Add match stack to the error message
- Add common errors to the Pegex grammar

- Refactor compression testing
  - compression equivalence is not a goal
  - s/\n/;/g *is* a goal

#------------------------------------------
- Pegex ->optimize (after combinate)
  - Combine consecutive .rgx
  - .all or .any of 1 elem => .rul
- Add a TIMER option
- Add benchmarks

# Research
- Look at Perl6::Rules on CPAN
- Look at Regex::Grammars
- Look at Parse::RecDescent tests

# Other Parsers to write
- Indentation parser
  - Maybe indentation rules can be grammar methods
- Tracing Parser
  - Move debug stuff out of Pegex::Parser
  - Count calls
  - NYTProf
- Backtracking parser subclass
  - Parse Name: First Middle? Last

# Other Receivers to write:
- AST receiver (most common base class) Pegex::Receiver::AST
- Streaming receiver (does about nothing) Pegex::Receiver
- TreeDump receiver (instead of wrap)
- Pegex::Receiver::Marpa

# Parser/Compilers to Write
- irssi.log parser
- arithmetic precedence
- Perl 5
- Perl 6
- CoffeeScript
- UniScript
- Kwim
- MarPeg
