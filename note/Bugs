== Bugs

Make these into GitHub issues once online:

- Empty regex seems to be a bug:

    a: //

  The compiler loops forever on this.

  Now I can't reproduce

- Pegex::Optimizer should detect unused receiver methods

  When changing rule names in a grammar, I often forget to change the receiver
  rule names to match. Pegex can detect this during optimization, and fail or
  warn. Might want an option to disable the warnings too.
